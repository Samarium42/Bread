Sales Prediction Hackathon


For the Analysis Part we divided each analysis task between the three team members and did in detail analysis and review of the three tasks given.

Analysis 1 : Which products generates the highest sales and profit?
From our analysis, we see that the Technology category contributes to both sales and profit the most, while Office Suppliers ranked last for sales and Furniture for profit. However, this is not completely reflected while looking at the sub-categories, as chairs (Furniture) has the highest sales and copiers (office suppliers) with the highest profit. Profits from tables, on the other hand, is the lowest with a loss greater than Â£50,000, which is very likely to be the main cause of the furniture category to rank last in terms of profits.


Analysis 2 - Analysing accessories purchased versus discounts, no clear pattern emerged. In fact, sales made were greatest at the time of lowest discounts. This may be due to the fact that less was spent, but I still would expect an increase in sales during sale times.

Analysis 3 - I had to analyse the sales and their correlation and distribution between different segments of buyers and by doing analysis according to average sales of each category of product bought, Technology products have the highest sales among all categories in all the three segments. 

Consumer Segment usually has the highest sales volumes though.
As the volumes are the highest from Consumer segment sales and profits are the highest from them as well.
